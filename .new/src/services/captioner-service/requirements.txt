# captioner service Service - Python Dependencies
# ============================================================================
#
# PURPOSE:
#   Python package dependencies for the captioner-service microservice in the
#   Video RAG system for processing video frames and generating results.
#
# DEPENDENCY CATEGORIES:
#   - Web Framework: FastAPI for REST API and health endpoints
#   - ASGI Server: Uvicorn for high-performance async serving
#   - Message Queue: Kafka client for event streaming integration
#   - Data Processing: Libraries specific to captioner-service functionality
#   - Monitoring: Logging and metrics collection dependencies
#
# SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS:
#   - All versions pinned to prevent supply chain attacks
#   - Regular security updates required for production deployment
#   - Vulnerability scanning recommended before deployment
#
# PERFORMANCE NOTES:
#   - Uvicorn with standard extras includes optimized HTTP parsing
#   - Kafka-python provides efficient message serialization
#   - FastAPI offers automatic API documentation and validation
