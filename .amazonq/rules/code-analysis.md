# Code Analysis Rules

## Codebase Analysis Framework

When analyzing codebases, provide structured overview covering:

### Core Components

- Major modules/components and their responsibilities
- Key classes, functions, and design patterns
- Architectural approaches and frameworks used

### Component Interactions

- Data and control flow between components
- Communication methods and APIs/interfaces
- Dependency injection and service patterns

### Deployment Architecture

- Build steps and external dependencies
- Environment requirements (dev/staging/prod)
- Infrastructure and containerization details

### Runtime Behavior

- Application initialization process
- Request/response handling mechanisms
- Business workflow execution
- Error handling and background tasks

## Analysis Standards

- Focus on technical understanding for developers
- Avoid personal opinions unless requested
- Highlight security, performance, and maintainability aspects
- Provide actionable insights for code improvements
